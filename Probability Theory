**Probability Integral Transform:**
For a continuous R.V X with a CDF F_X(x) the variable U=F_X(X) follows a uniform distribution [0,1] where 
U ~ U(0,1). 

Alternatively, as commonly seen for Monte- Carlo simulations, the inverse transform X=F_{X}^-1(U) can be used 
to obtain your desired distribution from a uniform random variable.
