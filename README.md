**Some of the explanations I write for myself as I learn concepts **

True Positive Rate:

False Positive Rate:

ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve): This is a method for evaluating the performance of a binary classification model. Balances the True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate 
probabilities to create a measure that is generally more appropriate for highly imbalanced data-sets. The balance of TPR and FPR into one metric can provide a more balanced view of the characteristics of a dataset.
