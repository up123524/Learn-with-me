# Learn-with-me

**Some of the explanations I write for myself as I learn concepts **

*My experiences high level overview:* 
The pareto principle applies in that 80% of the usefulness of a project is in 20% of the work. This is especially true of Data engineering where the marginal gains of creating an ever improving model pale in comparison to the gain made through proper evaluation, collection, cleaning and exploration of data. Despite python being somewhat dominant my personal taste for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) tends towards R as a software built by statisticians (Hadley Wickham is one of my personal heroes.) These incredibly powerful and easy to implement packages can represent that 20% of the work!!

Evaluate the use case of the model careful, statistical intution is a valuable skill and being able to accurately assess the validility of your approach before you start in regards to certain aspects e.g is it more valuable to minimise Type 1 or Type 2 error in my predictions is a multiplier in you workflow.
