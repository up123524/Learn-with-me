**Stochastic processes**

Independent and stationary increments: 

The values of the increments of a stochastic process X2-X1, X4-X3 are independent for disjoint time periods [t1,t2] [t3,t4] 

Analogous to independant R.V's we consider a stochastic process (e.g. Brownian Motion) to have this property. 

Stationary increments imply that the distribution of any given increment relies on the time length of the interval, not on the location of the interval. 
with the overall time scheme. 

Analogous to indentically distributed R.V's we consider a stochastic process (e.g. Poisson process) to have this property.

Martingales:
