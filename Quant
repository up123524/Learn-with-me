**Stochastic processes**

*Drift:*

*Diffusion:*

*Independent and stationary increments:* 

The values of the increments of a stochastic process X2-X1, X4-X3 are independent for disjoint time periods [t1,t2] [t3,t4] 

Analogous to independant R.V's we consider a stochastic process (e.g. Brownian Motion) to have this property. 

Stationary increments imply that the distribution of any given increment relies on the time length of the interval, not on the location of the interval. 
with the overall time scheme. 

Analogous to indentically distributed R.V's we consider a stochastic process (e.g. Poisson process) to have this property.

*Martingales:* 

A martingale is a key concept in quant finance and represents a process who's expected value is invariant under time. The expected future value is equal to the expected current value. 
More formally:
For a stochastic process ${X_t:t \geq 0}$ is a martingale with respect to filtration ${\mathscr{F}_t}$ (the set of information available until time $t$) if:
1. $X_t$ is adapted to filtration ${\mathscr{F}_t}$ (only depends on this information set)
2. $E(X_t) < \infty$ (finite expected value)
3. (The most crucial) $E(X_{t+s}|\mathscr{F}_t})=X_t$ for $s /geq 0$
It can be thought as analogous to a fair-game e.g. a coin toss where the value of heads is +1 and tails -1.
This suggests that the underlying process has no drift.
